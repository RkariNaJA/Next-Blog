## Mastering Next.js: **A Comprehensive Udemy Course for Developers**.

I recently completed a Next.js course on Udemy, and it was an amazing experience.

The course covered key concepts like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes,

with practical projects that helped me build fast, scalable applications.

It was a great way to level up my skills and gain confidence in using Next.js for real-world projects.

## Why should I use NextJS for my project?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, we'll dive into the projects that I have created:

- Next-Blog
- Next-Post
- User-Authentication-Demo Public
- ToDoList
- Foodies-Project
- NewsSite
